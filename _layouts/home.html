I will be joining Boston Consulting Group (BCG) as an Associate post graduation.
I am passionate about all things tech x entrepreneurship.

<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>I've worked in software, AI/ML, product management, sales and marketing, and venture capital
(whaaattt?! Yeah college really is a melting pot of diverse experiences).

<br>
Apart from dabbling in tech (robotics, AI/ML, iOT, AR/VR), I contributed to student welfare as a mentor and placement coordinator during my time at IIT Kharagpur.
You can view my resume <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P9RAuVMKN11DyEYfy3PkrUmArDoPzdSS/view?usp=sharing/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h3>
When I'm not working, I read fiction novels and enjoy competitive swimming.
I also love travelling and have a humongous bucket list of adventure sports I'm definitely going to get to (whatta clich√© amirite?)
Watching Formula 1 racing is my post-Covid favourite pastime. (for the sport and not the drama of course)

<h1>Resources</h1>
<h3>
The uplifting and students-supporting-students culture is one of the best things about IIT Kharagpur.
My seniors proved invaluable through their resources, insights, and mentorship during my time here.
Passing it along by attaching a list of curated academic and professional resources.

Please reach out if you have something I can add to the list or if you need any specific advice!

<h2>Courses</h2>
<h3>
A drive of class notes, books, tutorials, exam questions and solutions, and projects taken in (nearly) every course I have taken on campus ordered by semester and course name.
Semester 1 and 2 are common courses for all freshmen and there are already a wealth of resources from other students' initiatives, so I won't repeat them here.
I majored in Aerospace Engineering, did a minor in Computer Science and Engineering and a micro-specialization in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, so you can expect to find resources for courses from these departments below.

<h2>Internships and Placements</h2>
<h3>
These are the resources I followed for consulting and product management job profiles. While following this does not guarantee an internship or job offer, it's a good starting point in your job preparation journey!
It's worth mentioning that there are many other profiles such as software, AI/ML, finance, trading and even core research and foreign training internship and full-time roles for which I have not added any resources.
However, I can definitely guide you to the right people for these profiles if necessary.
