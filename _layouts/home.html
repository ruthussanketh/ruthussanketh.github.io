<h3>Hi! I'm Ruthu, currently a senior at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur.
I will be joining Boston Consulting Group (BCG) as an Associate post graduation.
I am passionate about all things tech x entrepreneurship.
Occasionally, I write about my work and experiences on <a href = "https://medium.com/@ruthussanketh">Medium</a>. <br><br>
Get in <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruthu-s-sanketh/">touch</a> if you're working on something interesting, have an idea, or just want to connect!

<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>I've worked in software, AI/ML, product management, sales and marketing, and venture capital
(whaaattt?! Yes I know I'm quite the explorer). You can view my resume <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P9RAuVMKN11DyEYfy3PkrUmArDoPzdSS/view?usp=sharing/">here</a>.

<br><br>
<h3>
When I'm not working, I read fiction novels and enjoy competitive swimming.
I also love travelling and have a humongous bucket list of adventure sports I'm definitely going to get to (whatta clich√© am I right?)
Watching Formula 1 racing is my post-Covid favorite pastime.
I also identify as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community and aim to increase representation and inclusivity as a woman in STEM.
