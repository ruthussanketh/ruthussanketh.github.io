I've worked in software, AI/ML, product management, sales and marketing, and venture capital (whaaattt?! Yeah college really is a melting pot of diverse experiences).

Apart from dabbling in tech (robotics, AI/ML, iOT, AR/VR), I contributed to student welfare as a mentor and placement coordinator during my time at IIT Kharagpur. You can view my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMEdLyj22dtTmAF4wwx8pblnzqC76GMS/view?usp=sharing).

When I'm not working, I read fiction novels and enjoy competitive swimming. I also love travelling and have a humongous bucket list of adventure sports I'm definitely going to get to. Watching Formula 1 racing is my post-Covid favourite pastime. (for the sport and not the drama of course)

I aim to increase representation and inclusivity as a member of the LGBTQIA+ðŸŒˆ community and a woman in STEM.
