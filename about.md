<h2> About Me </h2>
<h3>
I've worked in software, AI/ML, product management, sales and marketing, and venture capital
(whaaattt?! Yeah, college really is a melting pot of diverse experiences).

Apart from dabbling in tech (robotics, AI/ML, iOT, AR/VR), I contributed to student welfare as a mentor and placement coordinator during my time at IIT Kharagpur.

When I'm not working, I read fiction novels and enjoy competitive swimming.
I also love travelling and have a humongous bucket list of adventure sports I'm definitely going to get to.
Watching Formula 1 racing is my post-Covid favourite pastime. (for the sport and not the drama of course)

As a member of the LGBTQIA+ðŸŒˆ community and a woman in STEM, I aim to increase representation and inclusivity through conscious thought and action.
