### The uplifting and students-supporting-students culture is one of the best things about IIT Kharagpur. My seniors proved invaluable through their resources, insights, and mentorship during my time here. Passing it along by attaching a list of curated academic and professional resources.

Passing it along like Master Oogway.

Please reach out if you have something I can add to the list or if you need any specific advice!



Courses
-------

### A collection of class notes, books, tutorials, exam questions and solutions, and projects taken in (nearly) every course I have taken on campus ordered by semester and course name. Semester 1 and 2 are common courses for all freshmen and there are already a wealth of resources from other students' initiatives, so I won't repeat them here. I majored in Aerospace Engineering, did a minor in Computer Science and Engineering and a micro-specialization in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, so you can expect to find resources for courses from these departments below.

Internships and Placements
--------------------------

### These are the resources I used for consulting and product management roles during placements. While following this does not guarantee an internship or job offer, it's a good starting point in your job preparation journey! It's worth mentioning that there are many other profiles such as software, AI/ML, finance, trading and even core research and foreign training internship and full-time roles for which I have not added any resources. However, I can definitely guide you to the right people for these profiles if necessary.*   [Consulting](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oXh5yXATaMAsZmYZzk39zn_-aNcnpeiC?usp=sharing)
