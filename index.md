Introduction
Hi! I am Ruthu, a senior at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I will be joining Boston Consulting Group (BCG) as an Associate post graduation. I am passionate about all things tech x entrepreneurship. I occasionally write about my work and experiences on Medium. Get in touch if you're working on something interesting, have an idea, or just want to connect! (LinkedIn)

About Me
I've worked in software, AI/ML, product management, sales and marketing, and venture capital (whaaattt?! Yeah I know I'm quite the explorer). You can view my resume here.

When I'm not working, I read fiction novels and enjoy competitive swimming. I also love travelling and have a humongous bucket list of adventure sports I'm definitely going to get to (yes I know I'm a clich√©). Watching Formula 1 racing is my post-Covid favorite pastime. I also identify as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community and aim to increase representation and inclusivity as a woman in STEM.

Resources
My seniors proved invaluable through their resources, insights, and mentorship during my time at IIT Kharagpur. Passing it along by attaching a list of curated academic and professional resources. Please reach out if you have something I can add to the list or if you need any specific advice.

Courses
A drive of class notes, books, tutorials, exam questions and their solutions for (nearly) every course I have taken on campus ordered by semester and course name.

Projects
A drive of research papers, surveys, simulations, and documentation for every project undertaken either in the Department of Aerospace Engineering or other professors in the Institute.

Internships and Placements
While this is by no means an exhaustive or sure-shot list to be followed to land an internship or job offer, its an extensive set of books, tips, advice and other resources for almost standard all job profiles - software, AI/ML, product management and consulting. If nothing else, its a good starting point in your job preparation journey. Best of luck!
